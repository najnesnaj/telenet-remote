# telenet-remote
digibox remote control arduino sketch

the digicorder / digibox of telenet is out of sight (mounted on back of television)
...so remote controller did not work
-> you can buy ir-extenders -> this is cheap and easy -> and probably a better solution

this sketch however lets you automate the selection of channels
radio stations are on channel "900"
one push could send out three digits



arduino sketch adapted to telenet remote control
protocol is not recognised
so raw output is read, and send out again
